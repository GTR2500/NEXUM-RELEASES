# NEXUM

## Governing Technical Ecosystems

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-stable-blue.svg)](https://github.com/GTR2500/NEXUM-RELEASES/releases)

Nexum is not just software.

It is the structural answer to industrial technical chaos.

It was built from a simple conviction:
manufacturing complexity is not the problem.
Uncontrolled structure is.

Behind Nexum there is a mindset:
order over noise,
determinism over improvisation,
architecture over patchwork.

---

## The Architect

Nexum is designed and directed by Manuel Zago,
a systems thinker operating at the intersection of manufacturing, digital governance, and structural engineering logic.

His approach is not incremental automation.
It is systemic reorganization.

Where others add tools,
he defines contracts.

Where others rename files,
he governs vaults.

Where others generate exports,
he enforces structural integrity.

Nexum reflects that philosophy.

---

## The Mission

Bring order to technical ecosystems.

Not by simplifying reality,
but by structuring it.

Nexum governs:

- codification
- assemblies
- multi-extension CAD vaults
- dependency integrity
- ERP export contracts
- inter-module structural consistency

It does not automate tasks.
It stabilizes systems.

---

## Vision

Industrial environments accumulate entropy over time:
duplicate codes,
broken references,
legacy naming,
manual adjustments,
hidden inconsistencies.

Nexum introduces a deterministic governance layer
above the operational layer.

From file chaos
to structural architecture.

From reactive fixes
to controlled evolution.

---

## Identity

Nexum is a platform.
Not a utility.

It is designed for structured manufacturing environments
where technical integrity cannot degrade over time.

Determinism > Convenience.
Architecture > Improvisation.
System > Tool.

---

## Architecture

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| **Desktop runtime** | Electron 33 |
| **UI** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| **Technical parsing** | XLS/XLSX via xlsx |
| **Internal communication** | IPC isolated via contextBridge |

No mandatory backend.  
No required cloud dependency.

---

## Modular pipeline

The sequence is enforced

**Codexa → Axion → Structor → NexFlow**

Operating principles

- a module does not alter certified outputs produced upstream
- registries are monotonic and never reused
- collision guards are mandatory
- preview is a gate before execution
- exports are standardized
- audit is kept separate from target outputs

> **Determinism > Convenience**

---

## Codexa (Active)

Codexa is the identity engine.
It governs how technical elements are named, traced, and kept consistent across files, exports, and workflows.

What it delivers

- Unified codification that stays stable over time
- Multi-format governance (the same technical item can exist in many file types without fragmentation)
- Collision-safe operations (no silent overwrite, no ambiguous results)
- Preview-first execution (visibility before commitment)
- Clean exports designed for enterprise import pipelines

---

## Axion (Active)

Axion is the structure engine.
It builds and validates hierarchical structures so that complex assemblies remain coherent from engineering intent to operational reality.

What it delivers

- Hierarchical structure construction (parent → child consistency)
- Structural validation and integrity checks
- Export readiness for structured enterprise environments
- Audit separated from target outputs (traceability without contaminating production datasets)

---

## Structor (In development)

Structor is the transformation layer.
It is designed to convert engineering structure into production-ready structure without losing meaning, traceability, or responsibility boundaries.

Designed for

- Structure normalization and controlled transformations
- Translation from engineering assemblies to operational groupings
- Rule-driven restructuring with explicit audit trails
- Stability under change: evolve structure without breaking identity

---

## NexFlow (Planned)

NexFlow is the supervision and governance layer.
It is designed to ensure modules evolve together without drift, contradictions, or silent regressions.

Designed for

- Cross-module validation gates before execution
- Drift detection between upstream certified outputs and downstream usage
- Approval-style flow discipline: preview → validate → execute
- Controlled evolution with explicit compatibility boundaries

---

## CoreSync (Planned)

CoreSync is the backbone.
It is designed to synchronize shared state and enforce suite-wide contracts so that governance remains deterministic at scale.

Designed for

- Shared contract enforcement across modules
- Central consistency checks and policy application
- Suite-wide synchronization of governed identities and structures
- Standardized run lifecycle and unified operational conventions

---

## Ordinex (Planned)

Ordinex is the operational normalization layer.
It is designed to bridge technical structure with operational workflows while preserving identity and structural integrity.

Designed for

- Operational normalization driven by governed structures (not manual reconciliation)
- Workflow coherence across technical, production, and administrative layers
- Non-destructive mapping: preserve identity while adapting operational grouping
- Enterprise-ready datasets for repeatable execution

---

## Vaultis (Planned)

Vaultis is the enterprise vault governance layer.
It is designed to operate on entire CAD ecosystems, not isolated files.

Designed for

- Full re-codification of complete CAD vaults (Inventor, SolidWorks)
- Preservation of assembly relationships, references, and dependency integrity
- Non-destructive reorganization: no broken assemblies, no lost links
- Automated, governed organization of technical archives on the company server
- Migration from legacy naming chaos to structured, governed identity

Vaultis is not file renaming.
It is vault governance.

---

## Stratix (Planned)

Stratix is the intelligence layer.
It is designed to transform governed technical reality into insight, planning, and long-term evolution control.

Designed for

- KPI and performance intelligence derived from governed structures
- Early detection of structural anomalies and duplication patterns
- Planning views across projects and technical domains
- Governance dashboards for controlled ecosystem evolution

## Modules and roadmap

### Available now

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Codexa | Identity governance: stable codification across formats, collision-safe operations, preview-first execution |
| Axion | Structure governance: validated hierarchies, integrity checks, export readiness with separated audit |

### In development / planned

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Structor | Controlled transformation from engineering structure to operational structure, with traceability |
| NexFlow | Cross-module supervision: validation gates, drift detection, controlled evolution |
| CoreSync | Contract backbone: shared policy enforcement, deterministic synchronization |
| Ordinex | Operational normalization: workflow coherence without breaking identity |
| Vaultis | Enterprise CAD vault governance: re-codification preserving relationships + server organization |
| Stratix | Strategic intelligence: analytics, planning, and ecosystem evolution forecasting |

### Evolution principle

Modules are activated only when stable.
Each new layer increases governance depth without compromising what is already certified upstream.

Nexum does not add complexity.
It removes entropy.

---

## Governance

- `MODULE_REGISTRY` as the source of truth
- module state separated from licensing
- enabled/licensed gating at runtime

---

## Release policy

- only one stable release is published at a time
- each new stable release replaces the previous one
- versioning follows SemVer
- published artifacts are official builds produced by a controlled pipeline

This repository is not a historical archive.  
It is a stable release channel.

---

## Target users

Nexum is designed for

- structured manufacturing SMEs
- multi-job environments
- ERP contexts requiring codification consistency

It is not intended for hobby usage.

---

## Integrity

Each stable build

- derives from a segregated workspace
- is verifiable via hash
- respects declared inter-module contracts
