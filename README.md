# NEXUM

## Governing Technical Ecosystems

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-stable-blue.svg)](https://github.com/GTR2500/NEXUM-RELEASES/releases)

Nexum is not just software.

It is the structural answer to industrial technical chaos.

It was built from a simple conviction:
manufacturing complexity is not the problem.
Uncontrolled structure is.

Behind Nexum there is a mindset:
order over noise,
determinism over improvisation,
architecture over patchwork.

---

## The Architect

Nexum is designed and directed by Manuel Zago,
a systems thinker operating at the intersection of manufacturing, digital governance, and structural engineering logic.

His approach is not incremental automation.
It is systemic reorganization.

Where others add tools,
he defines contracts.

Where others rename files,
he governs vaults.

Where others generate exports,
he enforces structural integrity.

Nexum reflects that philosophy.

---

## The Mission

Bring order to technical ecosystems.

Not by simplifying reality,
but by structuring it.

Nexum governs:

- codification
- assemblies
- multi-extension CAD vaults
- dependency integrity
- ERP export contracts
- inter-module structural consistency

It does not automate tasks.
It stabilizes systems.

---

## Vision

Industrial environments accumulate entropy over time:
duplicate codes,
broken references,
legacy naming,
manual adjustments,
hidden inconsistencies.

Nexum introduces a deterministic governance layer
above the operational layer.

From file chaos
to structural architecture.

From reactive fixes
to controlled evolution.

---

## Identity

Nexum is a platform.
Not a utility.

It is designed for structured manufacturing environments
where technical integrity cannot degrade over time.

Determinism > Convenience.
Architecture > Improvisation.
System > Tool.

## Architecture

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| **Desktop runtime** | Electron 33 |
| **UI** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| **Technical parsing** | XLS/XLSX via xlsx |
| **Internal communication** | IPC isolated via contextBridge |

No mandatory backend.  
No required cloud dependency.

---

## Modular pipeline

The sequence is enforced

**Codexa → Axion → Structor → NexFlow**

Operating principles

- a module does not alter certified outputs produced upstream
- registries are monotonic and never reused
- collision guards are mandatory
- preview is a gate before execution
- exports are standardized
- audit is kept separate from target outputs

> **Determinism > Convenience**

---

## Codexa

Responsibilities

- parts codification (GR39)
- assembly codification (GR90<COMMESSA8>-FNNN)
- multi-extension rename clustered by BaseKey
- collision guards within and across groups
- Concept-ready exports

Contractual mapping CSV header (immutable order)

```
OLD_CODE;NEW_CODE;OLD_FILE;NEW_FILE;STATO
```

---

## Axion

Responsibilities

- hierarchical BOM construction
- parent-child validation
- export `AXION_DISTINTA_BASE_<COMMESSA8>.xls`
- audit JSON and technical diagnostic CSV

Loader priority

1. Manifest  
2. Explicit legacy fallback

## Modules and roadmap

### Available now

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Codexa** | Parts and assembly codification, mapping CSV, collision guards |
| **Axion** | Hierarchical BOM, parent-child validation, ERP-ready exports |

### In development

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Structor** | Structure-to-order transformation, technical normalization, library management |
| **NexFlow** | Approval flows between technical, production and administration, version validation |
| **CoreSync** | Shared services, data synchronization, inter-module contracts |
| **Ordinex** | Order normalization, workflow consistency |
| **Vaultis** | Artifact custody, audit trail, access policies |
| **Stratix** | Planning layer, analytics, KPI |

These modules extend the pipeline and will be released as they reach stable status.

---

## Governance

- `MODULE_REGISTRY` as the source of truth
- module state separated from licensing
- enabled/licensed gating at runtime

---

## Release policy

- only one stable release is published at a time
- each new stable release replaces the previous one
- versioning follows SemVer
- published artifacts are official builds produced by a controlled pipeline

This repository is not a historical archive.  
It is a stable release channel.

---

## Target users

Nexum is designed for

- structured manufacturing SMEs
- multi-job environments
- ERP contexts requiring codification consistency

It is not intended for hobby usage.

---

## Integrity

Each stable build

- derives from a segregated workspace
- is verifiable via hash
- respects declared inter-module contracts

---
